## :question: What is it 
a light version of the sequana-wrappers repository https://github.com/sequana/sequana-wrappers

## :dart: targetted audience

Sequana's developers.

The idea is that from sequana_pipetools, we can fetch this repo that will be a copy of the wrappers of sequana-wrappers without the test, documentation, large .git directory, etc

Yet, we need to make sure this is synchronised with the official wrappers, including tags.

There will be only one untest python file that will fetch the official directory, the tags, and the developers should then update this repository keeping the correct tag.

Only tagged version from sequana-wrappers should be included here.

From python using the update.py file provided:

    import update
    w = update.Wrapper()
    w.run("v24.8.29")

exit, and do:

    cd wrappers
    git commit  -m "Add wrapper.py files for tag v24.8.29"
    git tag v24.8.29
    git push origin main
    git push origin v24.8.29


One issue is that if you now consider adding an older tag, this rewrite history of the original wrappers. This is not a
big deal since this repo is not for developement. Yet, would be nice to have the same behaviour as the original wrappers
if we do a git clone. 

So consider reset the HEAD to the commit of the newest tag:

    git reset --hard v24.8.29 
    git push origin main --force
