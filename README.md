# sequana-wrappers-lite

## :question: What is it 
a light version of the sequana-wrappers repository https://github.com/sequana/sequana-wrappers

## :dart: targetted audience

Sequana's developers. The idea is that from sequana_pipetools, we can fetch this repo that will be a copy of the wrappers of sequana-wrappers without the test, 
documentation, large .git directory, etc

You can also use it in place of the official sequana-wrappers directory. 

There will be only one untest python file that will fetch the official directory and trim everything that is not a wrapper file so that the update of this repo is automatic.
